Makers Academy Week 2 - Student Directory TDD 
=============================================

Objective
---------
To apply the principles of Test Driven Development to our Student Directory project. 

Requirements
------------
Test driven development requires the developer to write a test, defining some specific functionality of the programme, before writing any code. This test will inevitably fail because the code to implement the functionality has not yet been written. After having watched the test fail, the developer should write the minimum amount of code to make the test pass, and no more. Once the test passes, the developer should refactor the code and ensure that everything still passes. 



Technical configuration
-----------------------
* Ruby
* RSpec
