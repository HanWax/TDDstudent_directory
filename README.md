Makers Academy Week 2 - Student Directory TDD 
=============================================

Objective
---------
To apply the principles of Test Driven Development to our Student Directory project. 

Requirements
------------
Test driven development requires a test, defining some specific functionality of the programme, to be written before any code. The developer must watch that test fail. After the test has failed, the developer should write the minimum amount of code that can pass the test (make it go green). After having made the test pass, the developer should then refactor the code and ensure that everything still passes. 



Technical configuration
-----------------------
* Ruby
* RSpec
* Github
